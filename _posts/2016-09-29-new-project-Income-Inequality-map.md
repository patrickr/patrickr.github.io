I have continued to work on the US Income Inequality Map I started in a previous post. It now has its own [github repo](https://github.com/patrickr/us-income-inequality-map) and project page with a [live demo](http://patrickr.xyz/us-income-inequality-map/) which I will continue to update as I make improvements.

coming soon:
    - color legend (hint: white/green = good, blue = bad)
    - click to zoom
    - county details
    - more local stats
