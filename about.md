I am a programmer and a maker!

I have focus on cross-platform applications in particular and have extensive experience with assembling and maintaining UNIX-based systems.  My languages of choice include Ruby, Javascript, and Typescript. I'm well-versed in web development and enjoy crafting software that's just as comfortable on the web as on the desktop.
